python4ScientificComputing, Numpy, Pandas and MATPLotLIB

# use of library:
1)numpy:NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations.

2)pandas:Pandas is a library created to help developers work with "labeled" and "relational" data intuitively. It's based on two main data structures: "Series" (one-dimensional, like a list of items) and "Data Frames" (two-dimensional, like a table with multiple columns). Pandas allows converting data structures to DataFrame objects, handling missing data, and adding/deleting columns from DataFrame, imputing missing files, and plotting data with histogram or plot box. It’s a must-have for data wrangling, manipulation, and visualization.

3)matplotlib:This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional diagrams and graphs (histograms, scatterplots, non-Cartesian coordinates graphs). Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries that are really useful in data science projects — it  provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications. 

# how to install library (for window user):
1) go into powershell
2) write 'pip install nameofthelibrary'
    ex: if you want to install numpy library
        'pip install numpy'
